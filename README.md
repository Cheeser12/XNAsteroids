XNAsteroids
===========

This was a project I undertook to recreate Asteroids using Microsoft's XNA framework. School got in the way and I ended up leaving it unfinished.
I've left this here purely as code that maybe some other programmer might find interesting. However, I still am working on [an Asteroids clone in Python...](https://github.com/Cheeser12/pysteroids "Pysteroids")
